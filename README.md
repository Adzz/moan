## You've Got the Func!

This repo is designed to teach the concepts behind functors, applicatives, monads and monoids.

Clone the repo.

Start with the `functor` branch. Have a look at the README, then run the specs and watch them fail. Your challenge is to make them pass, one at a time.

Move to `applicatives` next, then make it to `monads`!

If you get stuck, each branch has a corresponding `answers` branch - but no cheating!! You may want to check the answers branch each time you move on as the next branch builds on the previous one.
